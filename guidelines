- The client arg[1] will take the pid,
arg[2] will take the string that will be recieved by server

it will take that pid convert it to chars
divde it into chars, each char has 8 bits you will need to send each bit alone
the server will take the bit and store it in a char 
then print it it 

lookfor:
    getpid()
    kill()
    sigaction()
    signal()
    sigemptyset()
    sigaddset()


kill(pid, int); it sends signal to the specific pid;

signal(int, (void)(sig handler));
it handles the int (the signal that was recieved;

in the Server part: you are gonna recieve the signals from the client
here is the pseudocode --> you will check if recieved signal is SIGUSR1 or SIGUSR2, you will shift with one bit and put 1 or 2,
                            when you do this process for 8 times you should print that static character, initialize the character and the counter to 0 again

psuedocode for client----> you will check if there is 3 arguments (if the third is "", if pid is 0 or -1 or int min), you will convert the pid into integers using atoi,
                            you will count the string, then you will parse on every character on the string 8 times as the number of bits,
                            if it's 1 then send 1 if it's 0 send 0 using the kill funtion
